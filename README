== DESCRIPTION

Yea, I know what you are going to say. "I can do that with ___" Fill in the blank
with +grep+, +awk+, +sed+, +perl+, etc. But honestly, none of these tools are
Langauge 2.0 (read "post-Ruby"). What I want is a simaple commandline tool that
given me quick access to a Regular Expression engine. No more, no less.

Now I could have written this too in Perl. I'm sure it would just as good, if not
better since Perl's Regualar Expression engine rocks, or so I hear. But Ruby's is
pretty good too, and getting better (with 1.9+). And since I know Ruby very
well. Well that's waht you get.

== USAGE

Okay, check it out. It's real simple. Supply a regular expression and a file to
match upon to the +regex+ command.

  $ regex '=begin.*?\n(.*)=end' sample.txt

It does exactly what you think it would.

Check out the <tt>--help</tt> and I'm sure the rest will come to you real quick.
But it you want more information, then do us the good favor of jumping over
to the <a href="http://proutils.github.com/regex">documentation wiki</a>.

== STATUS

This is a very release. So don't expect every feature under the sun just yet, or
that every detail is going to work peachy keen. But hey, if something needs fixing
or a feature needs adding, well then get in there and send me a patch --open
source software is built on *TEAM WORK*.

And expect a potenial for rapid change here at the beginning.
