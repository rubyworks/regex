== DESCRIPTION

Yea, I know what you are going to say. "I can do that with ____" Fill in the blank
with +grep+, +awk+, +sed+, +perl+, etc. But honestly, none of these tools are
"Langauge 2.0" (read "post-Ruby"). What I want is a simple command-line tool that
gives me quick access to a Regular Expression engine. No more, no less.

Now I could have written this in Perl. I'm sure it would just as good, if not
better since Perl's Regualar Expression engine rocks, or so I hear. But Ruby's is
pretty damn good too, and getting better (with 1.9+). And since I know Ruby very
well. Well that's what you get.

== USAGE

Okay, check it out. It's real simple. Supply a regular expression and a file to
be searched to the +regex+ command.

  $ regex '=begin.*?\n(.*)\n=end' sample.rb

It does exactly what you would expect --returns the content between the first
<tt>=begin ... =end</tt> clause it comes across. To see all such comments, you can
use the <tt>--repeat</tt> option.

  $ regex --repeat '=begin.*?\n(.*)\n=end' sample.rb

By default +regex+ produces string output. Regular expression groups are delimited
by ASCII 29 (035 1D) END OF GROUP, and repeat matches are delimited by
ASCII character 30 (036 1E) END OF RECORD.

Instead of string output, +regex+ also supports YAML and JSON formats. E.g.

  $ regex --yaml --repeat '=begin.*?\n(.*)\n=end' sample.rb

In this case the returned matches are delimited using as an array of arrays.

Check out the <tt>--help</tt> and I am sure the rest will be smooth sailing.
But it you want more information, then do us the good favor of jumping over
to the wiki[http://wiki.github.com/proutils/regex].

== STATUS

This is a very early release. So don't expect every feature under the sun just yet,
or that every detail is going to work peachy. But hey, if something needs fixing
or a feature needs adding, well then get in there and send me a patch. Open
source software is built on *TEAM WORK*, baby.

And expect a potenial for rapid change here at the beginning.
