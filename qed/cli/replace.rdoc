== Search and Replace on Files

Given a file a.txt containing:

  This is file a.txt.
  This is an example.

And given a file b.txt containing:

  This is file b.txt.
  This is another example.

Then invoking the command:

  $ regex -s example -r EXAMPLE a.txt b.txt

Should result in a new file a.txt containing:

  This is file a.txt.
  This is an EXAMPLE.

And should result in a new file b.txt containing:

  This is file b.txt.
  This is another EXAMPLE.
